Before using:

~DO NOT change the name or edit the "codd.docx" file; the program is specifically looking for this named file to make a copy of and write out from. 

~If this file isn't present, the program will not run properly. 

~If this file has been changed, the program will blindly write the contents of the filled out .csv to that file.

How to use:
1.) If "template.csv" is not present, open the program and run "Generate Template".
	-The filled out .csv file is where the data create the certificates came from.
2.) Once the .csv is filled out, save and close before re-running the program.
3.) Upload the CSV to using the built-in file picker and click "Generate Certificates".
4.) A new .docx file should appear in the same folder it was run with.
